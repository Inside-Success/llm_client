# Changelog

All notable changes to `llm-client` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Timeout-policy log spam under `LLM_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_POLICY=ban`: the
  structured-call entrypoints no longer fill the library-default timeout
  (180s) when the caller passed `timeout=None` and the policy would discard
  it anyway, so `normalize_timeout` emits ZERO `TIMEOUT_DISABLED` records for
  default-only calls (previously one WARNING per call — 136/262 lines of a
  real CI run log). Explicit caller timeouts under the ban still warn, but
  once per caller per process (repeats at DEBUG). `allow`-policy behavior is
  unchanged.
- Provider errors masked as success: some providers report
  `finish_reason='error'` on a 200 response; litellm has no mapping for that
  value and normalizes it to `'stop'`, letting truncated content flow into
  schema validation. The structured runtimes (sync + async, native-schema +
  instructor) now check the RAW finish reason litellm preserves in
  `provider_specific_fields["native_finish_reason"]` BEFORE validation and
  raise the new retryable `LLMProviderResponseError` (enters the existing
  retry ladder; retry lines report `source=provider`).
- Retry-log diagnostics: retry warnings now carry the model id and `task=`
  (previously the only model mention came from the exception text — empty for
  litellm's `JSONSchemaValidationError`, which litellm raises with
  `model=""`), and error text is compacted via `_retry_error_summary`
  (schema-validation errors log exception class + schema TITLE + a 120-char
  raw-response snippet instead of the multi-KB full-schema `str()`; other
  errors are whitespace-collapsed and capped at 240 chars). Applies to the
  execution kernel and the OpenRouter key-rotation retry path.

### Added

- `LLMProviderResponseError` in `llm_client.core.errors` (retryable;
  `raw_finish_reason` attribute).
- `llm_client.utils.litellm_log_filters`: targeted filter on the `LiteLLM`
  logger (installed at import, idempotent) that suppresses ONLY litellm
  LoggingWorker `CancelledError`/`TimeoutError` tracebacks from
  `logging_worker.py` — benign shutdown noise, verified unfixed on litellm
  1.88.1 / 1.91.1 / current main. Other LoggingWorker errors and all other
  LiteLLM records pass through (proven by test).
- `tests/test_log_hygiene.py`: gates for the fixes above.

### Removed

- Dead Gemini native REST path (~730 lines): `_call_gemini_native`,
  `_acall_gemini_native`, and 9 supporting functions/constants. litellm 1.82.4
  has full native Gemini support; the hand-rolled path was never enabled by
  default. Gemini models now fall through to `litellm.completion` naturally.
  Dispatch simplified from 4 paths to 3 (Agent SDK / Responses API /
  litellm.completion).

### Added

- Sync/async `call_llm_json_schema` APIs and a versioned
  `python -m llm_client json-schema-call` bridge for non-Python consumers.
  Caller schemas use the established provider projection, structured repair,
  budget, cost, and observability runtime; the CLI contract contains no
  credential or endpoint fields.
- Shared execution-kernel primitives in `llm_client.execution_kernel`:
  - `run_sync_with_retry` / `run_async_with_retry`
  - `run_sync_with_fallback` / `run_async_with_fallback`
- Expanded identity characterization coverage:
  - `tests/test_model_identity_contract.py` now covers structured and
    streaming entrypoints (sync/async) in addition to text + MCP flows
  - added explicit structured fallback-chain characterization (sync/async)
    covering normalized attempted-model traces and resolved model identity
- Observability boundary modules in `llm_client.observability`:
  - `events.py`, `experiments.py`, `query.py`
- Modular CLI command package in `llm_client.cli`:
  - `cost.py`, `traces.py`, `scores.py`, `experiments.py`, `backfill.py`
- Regression coverage for architecture seams:
  - `tests/test_execution_kernel.py` (sync/async retry/fallback parity)
  - `tests/test_cli_smoke.py` (CLI split smoke/help coverage)
  - `tests/test_io_log_compat.py` (`io_log` delegation compatibility)
- MCP agent runtime controls for finalization reliability:
  - `finalization_fallback_models`
  - `forced_final_max_attempts`
  - `forced_final_circuit_breaker_threshold`
- Retrieval stagnation fuse for evidence loops:
  - `retrieval_stagnation_turns`
  - `retrieval_stagnation_action` (`force_final` | `observe`)
  - terminal event code `RETRIEVAL_STAGNATION`
  - non-terminal diagnostics code `RETRIEVAL_STAGNATION_OBSERVED`
- Extended MCP agent metadata and diagnostics:
  - finalization fallback usage/success/event traces
  - forced-final attempt and circuit-breaker telemetry
  - retrieval stagnation trigger/streak/turn metadata
  - `submit_validation_reason_counts` for submit-loop diagnostics
- OpenRouter key-pool rotation for key/quota exhaustion responses (`403` key
  limit and OpenRouter `402` insufficient credits):
  - supports `OPENROUTER_API_KEYS` and numbered `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_<n>` vars
  - rotates `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to the next key and retries immediately
  - emits `OPENROUTER_KEY_ROTATED` / `OPENROUTER_KEY_ROTATION_UNAVAILABLE` warnings
- Digimon benchmark lane controls wired through runner:
  - `--lane-policy {pure,reliability}`
  - `--finalization-fallback-models`
  - `--forced-final-max-attempts`
  - `--forced-final-circuit-breaker-threshold`
  - `--retrieval-stagnation-turns`
- Codex process-isolation runtime controls for non-streaming calls:
  - `codex_process_isolation` (kwarg)
  - `codex_process_start_method` (kwarg / `LLM_CLIENT_CODEX_PROCESS_START_METHOD`)
  - `codex_process_grace_s` (kwarg / `LLM_CLIENT_CODEX_PROCESS_GRACE_S`)
  - `LLM_CLIENT_CODEX_PROCESS_ISOLATION` (env default toggle)
  - process-safe result serialization for text/structured codex calls

### Changed

- Normalized reasoning controls now pass through generically. OpenRouter calls
  declare lagging LiteLLM-compatible controls, require a provider that supports
  them, and project local task/trace identity into the vendor Broadcast
  envelope without replacing local execution evidence.
- Opus-family models are hard-blocked across explicit routes, agent aliases,
  fallback legs, provider model arrays, registries, and workflow defaults.
  Opaque OpenRouter Auto Router and preset selection is rejected so an
  account-side route cannot bypass the ban.
- `call_llm` / `acall_llm` now use shared retry+fallback kernel paths instead
  of duplicated in-function retry/fallback loops.
- Timeout/error observability hardening:
  - blank exception strings (for example `TimeoutError()`) now emit non-empty
    messages (`TimeoutError`) in wrapped errors and retry/fallback logs.
  - Codex SDK timeouts now raise explicit structured messages
    (`CODEX_TIMEOUT[codex_call|codex_structured_call]`) including model and
    execution context (`working_directory`, `sandbox_mode`, `approval_policy`).
  - Codex timeout enforcement now uses a hard-timeout pattern
    (`asyncio.wait` + bounded cancellation grace) instead of relying only on
    `asyncio.wait_for`, which can stall when cancellation is suppressed.
  - Timeout diagnostics now include Codex exec lifecycle fields (first/last
    event timing, line counts, subprocess argv/pid) and best-effort process
    termination telemetry when cancellation does not complete.
  - Codex turn tasks now perform bounded cleanup on cancellation/timeouts to
    reduce lingering subprocess transport warnings after outer watchdog aborts.
  - Retry classification now treats timeout exception classes as retryable even
    when the exception message is empty.
- `call_llm_structured` / `acall_llm_structured` now route retry behavior for
  responses, native-schema, and instructor branches through shared
  execution-kernel retry primitives instead of local retry loops.
- `call_llm_structured` / `acall_llm_structured` now also route outer
  model-chain fallback behavior through shared execution-kernel fallback
  primitives (`run_sync_with_fallback` / `run_async_with_fallback`).
- Routing resolution now goes through a shared `_resolve_call_plan(...)` path
  for text/structured/stream entrypoints, so normalization events are logged
  consistently from one resolver seam.
- Structured result assembly/identity annotation now uses shared helper
  `_build_structured_call_result(...)` to reduce duplicated logic.
- `_agent_loop` now stages tool/contract initialization through typed
  `AgentLoopToolState` construction (`_initialize_agent_tool_state`).
- `_agent_loop` final metadata writeout is extracted into
  `_apply_agent_loop_metadata(...)` to reduce core-loop monolith size.
- `python -m llm_client` is now a thin command router; command logic moved out
  of `llm_client.__main__` into per-command modules.
- Top-level `llm_client` exports observability APIs via
  `llm_client.observability` boundaries.
- `llm_client.observability.experiments` and `llm_client.observability.query`
  now own concrete experiment/query implementations; `llm_client.io_log`
  delegates these APIs as a compatibility shim.
- Provider-empty taxonomy is canonicalized as `PROVIDER_EMPTY_CANDIDATES`
  (legacy aliases retained for compatibility).
- Forced-final path now attempts bounded model chains and keeps run-level
  failure attribution clean when fallback finalization succeeds.
- Benchmark summaries now report completion-conditioned accuracy plus provider,
  fallback, and retrieval-stagnation rates.
- Codex text/structured call paths can now run in a dedicated child process and
  enforce hard worker termination when SDK cancellation does not complete,
  preventing parent-loop stalls from cancellation-unresponsive turns.
- Codex reasoning effort normalization now coerces `minimal -> low` by default
  (override with `LLM_CLIENT_CODEX_ALLOW_MINIMAL_EFFORT=1`) to avoid known
  platform-side rejections when web search tooling is implicitly enabled.

### Fixed

- Completions and Responses cost accounting now prefer finite nonnegative
  provider-reported billing (including legitimate zero-cost calls), then
  LiteLLM's computed estimate, then the fallback floor.
- Instructor client construction is serialized through its supported public API
  so concurrent structured calls cannot race process-global registration.
- Cost queries serialize reads with writes on the shared SQLite connection,
  preventing concurrent budget checks and call logging from overlapping SQL
  statements.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-02-23

### Breaking Changes

- Removed model-semantics compatibility modes.
  - `ClientConfig.result_model_semantics` removed.
  - `LLM_CLIENT_RESULT_MODEL_SEMANTICS` removed.
- `LLMCallResult.model` now has one fixed meaning:
  - always the terminal executed model (same identity as `resolved_model`).
- Removed semantics-adoption telemetry controls:
  - `LLM_CLIENT_SEMANTICS_TELEMETRY` removed.
- Removed semantics reporting CLI commands:
  - `python -m llm_client semantics`
  - `python -m llm_client semantics-snapshot`

### Changed

- Identity contract is now single-path and explicit:
  - `requested_model` = caller input
  - `resolved_model` / `execution_model` = executed model
  - `routing_trace` = why routing/fallback changed the model
- Observability smoke workflow now validates logging-disabled mode only.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Typed runtime configuration via `ClientConfig`:
  - `routing_policy` (`openrouter` or `direct`)
  - `result_model_semantics` (`legacy`, `requested`, `resolved`)
- Pure routing resolver in `llm_client.routing`:
  - `CallRequest`
  - `ResolvedCallPlan`
  - `resolve_call(request, config)`
- Result identity fields:
  - `requested_model`
  - `resolved_model`
  - `execution_model` (alias of terminal execution identity)
  - `routing_trace`
- Machine-readable warning metadata:
  - `LLMCallResult.warning_records`
  - stable warning codes (`LLMC_WARN_*`)
- Deterministic tool-call compliance gate (`llm_client.compliance_gate`).
- Lightweight semantics-adoption telemetry for migration planning:
  - foundation events (`ConfigChanged`) with caller/source/mode metadata
  - env switch: `LLM_CLIENT_SEMANTICS_TELEMETRY=off`.
- Semantics snapshot CLI for daily migration tracking:
  - `python -m llm_client semantics-snapshot`
  - appends JSONL snapshot records with filters + aggregate adoption summary.
- GitHub Actions smoke workflow for observability toggles:
  - `.github/workflows/smoke-observability.yml`
  - validates telemetry/logging disabled mode.

### Changed

- All major call paths now support explicit typed config (`config=ClientConfig(...)`),
  including tool, stream, and batch wrappers.
- Routing behavior is resolved through typed, testable plan objects instead of
  scattered ad-hoc normalization in call sites.
- Integration tests are gated by marker + env:
  - default `pytest` excludes `integration`
  - enable with `LLM_CLIENT_INTEGRATION=1`.
- Added CLI adoption report:
  - `python -m llm_client semantics`
  - summarizes semantics mode/source usage from `foundation_events`.
- Added telemetry-off contract test:
  - `LLM_CLIENT_SEMANTICS_TELEMETRY=off` suppresses foundation event emission.

### Compatibility Notes

- `result.model` remains compatibility-first by default (`legacy` semantics).
- Consumers can opt into deterministic identity semantics now:
  - `ClientConfig(result_model_semantics="requested")`
  - `ClientConfig(result_model_semantics="resolved")`
  - or `LLM_CLIENT_RESULT_MODEL_SEMANTICS=...`.
- Canonical identity for new consumers:
  - caller identity: `requested_model`
  - execution identity: `resolved_model` / `execution_model`.

### Validation

- Full test suite passed at release cut:
  - `757 passed, 1 skipped`.
