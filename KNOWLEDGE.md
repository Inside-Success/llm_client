Exact `gpt-5.4` requests must canonicalize to the Codex SDK route, not
OpenRouter. The earlier routing contract only recognized `codex/...`,
`codex-mini-latest`, and `*-codex` family names, so bare or provider-prefixed
`gpt-5.4` could slip into `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4` and burn credits outside
the subscription-backed Codex path. `llm_client` now treats exact `gpt-5.4`
as a Codex alias across routing, agent detection, availability checks, and
rate-limit provider classification.

**Ecosystem audit findings (Phase 7 of infra sprint).**

Health: 1240 tests, 94% pass rate, no circular imports, clean architecture.

Issues found:
1. Plan #17 (text_runtime sync/async dedup) cancelled but 400 LOC duplication
   remains in execution/text_runtime.py. High maintenance risk — bug fixed in
   one path but missed in other. Consider un-cancelling.
2. KNOWLEDGE.md was empty until this entry. Agents should use /learned to
   record findings during debugging sessions.
3. 5 test_models.py failures due to stale model ranking expectations
   (gemini-2.5-flash vs gemini-3-flash-preview). Parameterize or update.
4. test_public_surface.py expects 118 exports, actual is 120. Trivial fix.
5. Gate-edit hook test overly strict on doc files. Gate should skip non-source.

**When a shared-infrastructure repo already has a registry row, the next
truthful step is a repo-local ownership source and sanctioned workflow
alignment, not more project-meta prose.**

The `llm_client` rollout showed a sharper failure mode than bootstrap-minimal
repos: the shared registry already knew about llm_client, but the repo still
lacked its own ownership source of record and its declared sanctioned worktree
policy did not match the actual Makefile/scripts surface.

Practical rule:

- if a shared repo is already registry-covered, add the local capability source
  and align declared workflow policy before expanding the registry further

**Portable workflow packaging should be staged as a runtime-facing manifest and validator layer before any registry or installer work.**

Journey, Anthropic's workflow-vs-agent framing, `static_pipeline`, and
`llm_client`'s existing LangGraph slice all point to the same boundary:
`llm_client` is the natural home for runtime-facing package truthfulness
(manifest models, capability-based runtime support, validation, and example
adapters), but not for registry/community/product concerns. A runtime list
without capability validation is not a truthful portability claim.

### 2026-04-04 — codex — bug-pattern

**Repeated submit-validator rejections that explicitly require the forced-terminal path should short-circuit the loop instead of burning the remaining tool budget.**

In DIGIMON's benchmark lane, the normal submit gate correctly rejected pending
semantic-plan atoms, but the generic MCP loop then kept searching and
re-submitting until budget exhaustion even after the validator signaled both
`new_evidence_required_before_retry` and `requires_forced_terminal_path`.
`mcp_turn_outcomes.py` now treats repeated rejections of that shape as early
control churn and forces finalization immediately. Verified in
`tests/test_mcp_agent.py::test_repeated_submit_rejections_can_force_final_early`.

### 2026-04-04 — codex — integration-issue

The installed Codex SDK can fail on file-writing runs before llm_client
finalizes an agent result because the SDK parser still rejects
`FileChangeItem.status="in_progress"`.

Measured behavior:
- trivial `acall_llm("codex", ...)` text runs still succeed
- heavier repo-mutating prompts can raise:
  `ValidationError: FileChangeItem.status Input should be 'completed' or 'failed'`

Runtime implication:
- `codex_transport="auto"` must treat that exact ValidationError family as a
  transport-compatibility failure and fall back to CLI
- keep the fallback rule narrow so unrelated Pydantic validation failures still
  surface normally

### 2026-04-04 — codex — bug-pattern

The Codex CLI transport path in `llm_client/sdk/agents_codex.py` can silently
rot if it is only exercised through mocked dispatch tests.

Measured failure:
- forcing `LLM_CLIENT_CODEX_TRANSPORT=cli` from a real OpenClaw run failed
  immediately with `name 'subprocess' is not defined`
- root cause was simple: `_call_codex_via_cli()` used `subprocess.run(...)`
  but the module did not import `subprocess`

Current safe rule:
- keep one direct unit test that executes `_call_codex_via_cli()` with
  `subprocess.run` monkeypatched and verifies the output file is read back
- transport-selection tests alone are not enough; the concrete CLI helper must
  be exercised too

### 2026-04-05 — codex — bug-pattern

`io_log` must not cache `LLM_CLIENT_LOG_ENABLED` only at import time if tests
or callers rely on env-based suppression after module import.

Measured failure:
- `tests/test_client.py::TestAsyncResponsesAPIRouting::test_async_gpt5_routes_to_aresponses`
  could hang on a locked shared observability SQLite DB during
  `log_foundation_event()`
- the suite-level fixture set `LLM_CLIENT_LOG_ENABLED=0`, but foundation-event
  writes still ran because `io_log._enabled` had already been initialized from
  the old environment

Current safe rule:
- logging enablement should resolve dynamically from the environment unless an
  explicit runtime/test override has been set on `io_log._enabled`
- foundation-event logging must honor the same suppression contract as the rest
  of `io_log`, otherwise async client verification can fail for unrelated
  environmental DB contention

### 2026-04-05 — codex — bug-pattern

**OpenRouter routing should normalize explicit `google/...` provider ids the same way it already normalizes other provider-prefixed models.**

`ac14` surfaced repeated provider-resolution failures from `MODEL=google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`.
Under OpenRouter policy, `llm_client.core.routing.normalize_model_for_policy()`
left `google/...` untouched, so the call reached LiteLLM without a provider
route and failed as "LLM Provider NOT provided". Fix: normalize `google/...`
to `openrouter/google/...` in the shared routing layer so stale but otherwise
valid OpenRouter Google aliases do not fail late inside structured-call
boundaries.

### 2026-04-05 — codex — bug-pattern

**In-process semaphores are not enough to stop shared quota bursts when multiple repos run concurrently; 429s need a cross-process provider cooldown.**

The April 3 Gemini anomaly cluster hit several active projects at once, which
means each process could respect its own semaphore and still collectively hammer
the same provider quota. `llm_client.utils.rate_limit` now combines a lower
default Google concurrency ceiling with a SQLite-backed shared cooldown window
that every process/worktree checks before starting the next Gemini call. The
execution kernel registers that cooldown on any 429-like failure, including
quota-exhausted errors that are intentionally not retried.

### 2026-04-05 — codex — bug-pattern

**Bare `gemini-*` model ids are not stable provider identities and should be canonicalized before policy routing.**

`theory-forge` surfaced a 100% failure lane on `gemini-2.5-flash` with
`Google Cloud SDK not found`, which was not a real provider outage. The actual
bug was that `normalize_model_for_policy()` handled `google/...` aliases but
left bare `gemini-*` ids untouched, so LiteLLM guessed the wrong Google path.
Fix: canonicalize bare Gemini ids to `gemini/<id>` before both direct and
openrouter policy handling.

### 2026-04-05 — codex — bug-pattern

**Cross-process provider leases must be acquired after the local semaphore, not before it.**

The first implementation of shared Gemini leases in `llm_client.utils.rate_limit`
grabbed a SQLite-backed lease before the in-process semaphore. Under local
concurrency, queued callers then consumed shared lease slots while they were
still waiting inside the same process, which made the next waiter sleep until
lease TTL expiry instead of real request completion. Fix: acquire the local
provider semaphore first, then claim the shared lease immediately before the
actual call window. This preserves the cross-process cap without turning local
queueing into false shared saturation.
