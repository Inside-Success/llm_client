## Start Here

1. [README.md](../README.md) for installation, usage, routing, and examples.
2. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for repo operating rules and architectural boundaries.
3. [docs/plans/01_master-roadmap.md](plans/01_master-roadmap.md) for the current long-term program state.

## Core Runtime Surface

- `acall_llm` - Async version of call_llm. Same three-tier routing (Agent SDK / Responses API / Completions).
- `acall_llm_batch` - Run multiple LLM calls concurrently with semaphore-based rate limiting.
- `acall_llm_structured` - Async version of call_llm_structured.
- `acall_llm_structured_batch` - Run multiple structured LLM calls concurrently.
- `acall_llm_with_tools` - Async version of call_llm_with_tools.
- `activate_experiment_run` - No docstring available.
- `activate_feature_profile` - Return the context manager that binds a feature profile for nested calls.
- `aembed` - Async version of embed(). See embed() for full docs.
- `ActiveExperimentRun` - Bind an existing run id as the active experiment context.
- `ActiveFeatureProfile` - Bind a feature profile as the active profile in the current context.
- `AgentDecisionMixin` - Mixin for schemas where the agent makes a judgment driving downstream action.
