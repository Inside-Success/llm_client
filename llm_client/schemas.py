"""Pydantic schema representations of core dataclass types.

LLMCallResult and EmbeddingResult are dataclasses for performance and
simplicity in the hot path.  This module provides parallel Pydantic models
so the @boundary decorator can register proper JSON schemas in the
contract registry without changing the runtime types.

Usage:
    from llm_client.schemas import LLMCallResultSchema
    schema = LLMCallResultSchema.model_json_schema()
